the color of the text within the labels are randomly altered.

# App Idea
App name: Miki
App Description: Miki is a personalized life coach that keeps you on track
to complete your goals. This can be achieved through ChatGPT integration in which
you have a discussion about what you would like to achieve and the steps necessary 
to complete it. Siri will also be integrated so that the app can provide daily 
reminders on tasks that need to be completed. The app holds you accountable by prompting
the user to upload documentation (picture/document file) to verify task completion.
In the event you were supposed to go somewhere on a particular day, the app will
prompt permisson for location services so that it can verify your attendance.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I accidentally created an extraneous connection from an element
to the ViewController script. Then I had to go to the connections inspector
and remove the connection.
